<H3> Week 2 | Computer-aided Design Assignment</h3>
<p> 
The assignment for the week was to create an enclosure for an Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate, ...) and document it on my Class Page using Fusion360. I included pictures and original files on my page. I mentioned what worked and did not work when creating the enclosure.
  
</p>
This was a difficult project at first but once I got a handle on how to use fusion 360 it became easier to use and make my stamp.

<H3>Fusion 360</h3>
<p>
 What i did was used fusion 360 to design a cylinder stamp with a sphere for the handle. The Put my Initials into the stamp to Read IB (Images 1, 2, 3,4)  |   Then i had to melt wax with a spoon and candle so I could show my stamp on a piece of paper. (Images 5 and 6)

	<h3> Designs To Improve</h3>
<p>
The first thing I had to do to fix my stamp was shrink it to 30% of the original model. One thing i would have done to improve my stamp is Not extrude my initials so much. This is because the wax went into the wholes of the B, which was suppose to happen but since the extrude was to large it wouldnt fully shape to the letter
