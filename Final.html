<h3> FINAL PROJECT</h3>
<p>
The production of your final project must utilize at least four different pieces of equipment and/ or significantly different process.  It is highly recommended you discuss your project idea in advance with me to get permission
 for your final project.  The preferred final project will involve four different pieces of equipment, but it is possible to submit multiple projects to meet this criteria.   All final projects must be original in creation 
 and not created by anyone else.   It the work is not original, it will be considered a violation of our Honor Code.   The project will be assessed based upon the quality, complexity, processes used, aestetics and functionality.  
 You must create a separate page that documents how the project was created with multiple pictures documenting each step of the process.   The page should model an <a href=http://www.instructables.com/> Instructables </a> page.
